              <h3>Western Education</h3>
              <p>A well-rounded education is of paramount importance at
Methodist Junior high School. We guide all students to develop personal
integrity and leadership skills, which they can draw from for
the rest of their lives. We would love to help you understand
the unique benefits that we have to offer at Methodist juniorhigh School, where we encourage each child to develop as a
confident lifelong learner as 21 century student</p>
						  <p></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Special Education</h3>
              <p>  Normally, students who meet this criterion have needs that can’t be met in a regular classroom. Learning environments, teaching approaches, and curricula may need to be adapted to support them. This tailored approach isn’t normally offered in general education.


</p>
						  <p> 
Not every student is entitled to a special education, though. To qualify, your child must have an identifiable disability. And this disability must interfere with their school performance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Vocational Training</h3>
              <p> The School gives Vocational education and training which provides learners with essential skills enhancing their employability, supporting their personal development and encouraging active citizenship.</p>
